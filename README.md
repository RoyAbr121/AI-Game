This is a pixel game I wrote as part of my course in Artificial Intelligence. The game pits two teams of two NPCs to hunt down and destroy one another through a maze of rooms connected by tunnels. The NPCs employ the A* ("A Star") algorithem to navigate to their intended target. The current target of each NPC is determined by a decision tree (see below), which includes actions such as "aquire ammunition" or "get healthpack".
